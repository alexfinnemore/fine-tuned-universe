# Universe K

A narrative AI universe that generates complex, scientifically-grounded stories about encoding messages through biological cryptography.

## Concept

**Universe K** tells the story of K., a young, isolated man in Prague who attempts to encode a message across time using mycelial networks and quantum encryption. The narrative combines:

- **Hard science**: Mycelial biology, quantum cryptography, information theory
- **Literary depth**: Kafka's themes, ontological doubt, Prague's labyrinthine atmosphere
- **Philosophical weight**: Existence, identity, love across time, reasonable paranoia
- **Poetic beauty**: The final mycelial bloom revealing the encrypted message

## Story Elements

From the original brief (see `/Data/Universes/Universe K/Universe K INPUT.md`):

> K., a real loner with deep introverted sense and doubt in his own ontology, sees himself only as a temporary, dynamic locus of data. He's in Prague following in Kafka's haunted footsteps. In love with an unattainable beauty (Z) whom he observes only from afar. His goal: leave an encrypted message for a future Z. After marking stones fails (cleaning crews erase them), he encodes the message in mycelial networks growing in his dank room. The story culminates with a citywide mycelial bloom where spores drift into the sky, spelling out something beautiful and poetic.

## Corpus Files

The universe's knowledge base consists of:

### 1. `mycelium-networks.md`
- Fungal biology and structure
- Hyphal networks and communication
- Electrical and chemical signaling
- Spore dispersal mechanics
- Environmental sensing
- Network intelligence research
- Urban mycology in Prague's climate

### 2. `quantum-encryption.md`
- Classical and quantum cryptography
- Quantum key distribution (BB84, E91)
- Post-quantum cryptography
- Encryption theory and practice
- Information-theoretic security
- Biological encoding methods
- Steganography and time-release cryptography

### 3. `kafka-prague.md`
- Kafka's life and works (especially *The Castle*)
- Prague's architecture and atmosphere
- Ontological doubt and existential themes
- The gaze and surveillance
- Haunting and reincarnation
- Prague as coded text

### 4. `narrative-voice.md`
- K.'s character psychology
- Z. as unattainable beloved
- The encryption plan (stones → mycelium)
- Paranoia and cleaning crews
- Prague as executable code
- The climactic mycelial bloom
- Possible message contents
- Narrative style and structure

## Configuration

Key settings in `config.yml`:

- **Creativity**: `very-high` - Maximizes imaginative freedom while staying grounded
- **Output Length**: `long` - Generates extensive detail for novel outlines
- **Tone**: "philosophical, scientific, melancholic, precise, labyrinthine"
- **Rules**: Ground speculation in science, maintain K's perspective, balance intelligibility with complexity

## Usage

### Generate Novel Outline

```bash
npm run chat

You: Create a detailed novel outline for K's story

Universe K: [Generates comprehensive multi-chapter outline with scientific detail, philosophical depth, and narrative arc]
```

### Explore Specific Aspects

```bash
You: Explain how K. would encode information in mycelial growth patterns

You: Describe the climactic mycelial bloom scene in detail

You: What would the decrypted message say?

You: Write Chapter 3: K. discovers the cleaning crews are code-breakers
```

## Expected Output Characteristics

When generating content, Universe K should:

- **Ground speculation in science**: Real biology, real physics, real cryptography
- **Maintain K.'s voice**: Paranoid, melancholic, technical, poetic
- **Blend domains**: Science + literature + philosophy
- **Create complex but coherent narratives**: On the edge of intelligibility
- **Generate detailed structure**: Multi-chapter outlines with technical specifics
- **Achieve emotional resonance**: Beautiful, melancholic, transcendent

## Success Criteria

Universe K works when it:

1. Generates coherent 10-15 chapter novel outlines
2. Accurately represents mycelial biology
3. Correctly explains quantum encryption concepts
4. Maintains Kafkaesque atmosphere
5. Creates emotionally resonant conclusions
6. Balances technical precision with poetic language
7. Stays grounded while being imaginative

## Design Philosophy

Universe K is intentionally our **most complex test case**:

- If the system handles this level of interdisciplinary complexity, it can handle anything simpler
- Tests integration of technical knowledge (biology, physics) with literary/philosophical depth
- Demonstrates long-form generation capability
- Validates corpus-based personality system

## Inspiration

- **Kafka**: *The Castle*, *The Trial*, ontological doubt
- **Mycelial intelligence**: Paul Stamets, Merlin Sheldrake (*Entangled Life*)
- **Quantum cryptography**: Bennett & Brassard (BB84), Ekert (E91)
- **Prague**: Medieval architecture, labyrinthine streets, stone and fog
- **Encoding life**: Craig Venter's synthetic biology, DNA data storage

**Universe K is the message. The message is Universe K. The reader is Z. The spores are words. The bloom is revelation.**
