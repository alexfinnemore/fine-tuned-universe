# Mycelial Networks: Biology and Communication

## Structure and Function

Mycelial networks are the vegetative part of fungi, consisting of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae. These networks can span vast areas underground, forming what scientists call the "wood wide web."

### Key Characteristics

- **Hyphal structure**: Individual threads (hyphae) are typically 2-10 micrometers in diameter
- **Growth patterns**: Can extend at rates of 1 km of hyphae per day in some species
- **Network topology**: Resembles both small-world and scale-free network architectures
- **Longevity**: Some mycelial networks (like Armillaria ostoyae) can live for thousands of years and cover thousands of acres

## Information Transfer

Mycelial networks transmit information through multiple mechanisms:

### Electrical Signaling

- Action potentials similar to neural signals in animals
- Propagation speeds: 0.5-2 mm/second
- Can encode different types of information based on spike patterns
- Voltage changes of 4-8 mV detected across hyphae

### Chemical Communication

- Release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
- Transfer of nutrients, water, and signaling molecules
- Alarm signals can spread through entire networks
- Enzymatic cascades triggered by environmental changes

### Resource Distribution

- Preferential allocation to productive nodes
- Memory-like behavior in resource routing
- Network optimization similar to ant colony algorithms
- Can "remember" locations of nutrient sources

## Spore Dispersal

Spores are the reproductive units of fungi, designed for information preservation and dispersal:

### Spore Properties

- **Size**: Typically 3-20 micrometers
- **Durability**: Can survive extreme temperatures, radiation, vacuum of space
- **Quantity**: A single mushroom can release billions of spores
- **Distribution**: Wind, water, animals, active discharge mechanisms
- **Longevity**: Viable for decades or centuries under right conditions

### Spore Development

- Produced in specialized structures (basidia, asci)
- Genetic information perfectly preserved
- Can contain dormant metabolic machinery
- Activate when conditions are favorable

## Cryptobiotic States

Mycelial networks and spores can enter dormant states:

- Metabolism reduced to near-zero
- DNA repair mechanisms remain active
- Can survive desiccation, freezing, oxygen deprivation
- Revival possible after decades or longer

## Environmental Sensing

Mycelia respond to:

- Chemical gradients (chemotaxis)
- Moisture levels
- Temperature fluctuations
- Light (some species)
- Electrical fields
- Mechanical stress
- pH changes

## Network Intelligence

Research suggests mycelial networks exhibit:

- **Problem-solving**: Can find shortest paths through mazes
- **Decision-making**: Resource allocation based on cost/benefit
- **Learning**: Habituation to repeated non-threatening stimuli
- **Memory**: Network structure encodes environmental history
- **Anticipation**: Preparatory responses to predicted events

## Symbiotic Relationships

Mycorrhizal associations with plants:

- 90% of plant species form these partnerships
- Bidirectional nutrient exchange
- Stress signaling between plants
- Pathogen defense coordination
- Multi-plant network formation

## Urban Mycology

Fungi in built environments:

- Stone surfaces (like Prague's cobblestones) host specialized species
- Moisture accumulation in dark spaces promotes growth
- Cold-tolerant species thrive in dank rooms
- Can grow on minimal nutrients (dust, organic particles)
- Root systems penetrate mortar, brick, plaster

## Experimental Applications

- **Bio-computing**: Mycelial logic gates and memory storage
- **Sensing networks**: Environmental monitoring
- **Material engineering**: Mycelium-based construction
- **Data encoding**: Theoretical use of growth patterns for information storage

## Relevant Species for Prague Climate

Cold and damp-tolerant fungi:

- *Serpula lacrymans* (dry rot fungus) - thrives in damp buildings
- *Coniophora puteana* (cellar fungus)
- *Stachybotrys chartarum* (black mold)
- Various lichen species on stone
- Wood-decay fungi in humid, dark conditions

## Time Scales

- Spore activation: Hours to days
- Hyphal extension: Millimeters per hour
- Network establishment: Days to weeks
- Mature network: Months to years
- Spore dispersal event: Seconds to hours (can release billions)
- Spore viability: Decades to centuries
