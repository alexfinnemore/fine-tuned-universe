** Universe Description

the universe of a young man (we call him K) , a real loner with deep introverted sense and doubt in his own ontology. He sees himself only as a temporary, dynamic locus of an overwhelming amount of data, ancient and contemporary and everything in between. Electromagnetic. He is in Prague following in the haunted footsteps of Kafka, and at times he feels he might be a reincarnation of sorts, caught in the abyss of the Castle. It is the labyrinthine Prague we are traveling in here, cobblestones, stone walls, spires and complex decorative architecture. Everything looks like a code to K. he is in love with an unattainable beauty (Z) whom he observes (not quite stalks) but only from afar. She is not aware of him. His goal is to leave a simple encrypted message for a future Z, who he hopes to meet in the distant future. Discuss past and future lives but he can't really put much faith in it. He tries to mark stones but finds them scrubbed and cleaned - suspects the cleaning crews are code-breakers and eventually comes up with an incredibly complex encryption by somehow (possibly insanely) encoding it in the roots of fungi and cold growing in his dark, dank room. Please Combine very detailed knowledge of mycelium networks and how they transmit messages with extremely detailed knowledge and explanation of modern encryption including quantum. He makes myriad guesses about how his message is proceeding but is concerned about its corruption, or worse, interception. A reasonable paranoia let us say. The story culminates at some time in the far distant future with an extraordinary scene where the entire city erupts in mycelial boom and spores drift up in huge clouds into the sky. Whoever or whatever is there are non-plussed But something very beautiful and poetic is spelled out. I don't know what yet. Suggest? This novel can be on or over the edge of intelligibility as long as it's grounded in science.
